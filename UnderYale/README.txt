The File above Contains all of the mp3s and custom sprites that were loaded into the program incase they are needed to run the game later

Credit where credit is due, the sprites accept for the Harvard crest,Yale crest, and the battle box background are all by Toby Fox and have been edited for satire of this non-profit game

The music is also By Toby Fox the originals are here, They too have been edited for satire

Seeing as I already dont own any of the assets people are free to use them anb the project as they please, I could indeed care less about this project so im not going to start carring now.

Thank you for playing if you did, (not to sound flat about it but) not that it matters. lol.
